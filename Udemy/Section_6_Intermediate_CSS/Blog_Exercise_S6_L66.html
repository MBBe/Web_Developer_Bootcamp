		<p class= "one">Mom, is that you? Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. He's an absolute dream. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. </p> 

		<p class= "two">Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

		Huh? Alright, we're the pinheads. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.</p>
